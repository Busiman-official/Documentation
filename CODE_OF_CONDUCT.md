Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Version 2.1, December 2020

Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, insulting/derogatory comments, and exclusionary language.

Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at hello@busiman.in. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public channels when an individual is representing the project.
