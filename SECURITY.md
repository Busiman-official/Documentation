Security policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately by emailing security@busiman.in with a clear description, steps to reproduce, and any relevant files or screenshots.

Do not open a public issue for vulnerabilities â€” this helps prevent accidental disclosure.

We will respond as soon as possible and work with you to coordinate a fix and disclosure.

[Note] Replace security@busiman.in with your preferred security contact or link to your vendor's advisory process.
