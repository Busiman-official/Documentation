# Requests & Approvals

Manage inventory requests, approval workflows, and transaction tracking across your warehouses. Learn how to handle pending requests, approve cross-warehouse transfers, and maintain proper inventory control through structured request management.

## üìã **What are Requests & Approvals?**

The Requests & Approvals system in Busiman provides structured control over inventory movements, ensuring that all stock transfers require proper authorization and tracking. This system prevents unauthorized inventory changes and maintains audit trails for all transactions.

    B --> D[üè≠ Cross-Warehouse]
    B --> E[üì§ Check-Out]

    C --> F[Auto Approved]

    G --> I[‚úÖ Accept]
    G --> J[‚ùå Reject]

    I --> K[Stock Moved]
    J --> L[Request Cancelled]
```

## üìã **Cross-Warehouse Requests**

The Requests & Approvals system primarily handles **cross-warehouse transfers** - the only transfer type that requires approval before stock movement occurs. As shown in the diagram above, internal store transfers and check-out requests are processed immediately without creating approval requests.

### **Cross-Warehouse Transfer Process**

**Approval Required**: When products need to move between different warehouses, the receiving warehouse must approve the transfer before stock is actually moved.

- **Sending Warehouse**: Initiates the transfer request
- **Receiving Warehouse**: Reviews and approves/rejects the request
- **Approval Workflow**: Manager-level review required before stock movement
- **Reserve Store**: Approved products are automatically allocated to Reserve Store
- **Rejection**: If rejected, stock remains in the sending warehouse

## üìä **Managing Requests**

Access request management through your warehouse dashboard:

1. **Navigate**: Dashboard ‚Üí Inventory ‚Üí Warehouse ‚Üí Requests
2. **Filter Options**:
   - **By Request**: View requests grouped by request ID
   - **By Product**: View individual products across requests
3. **Status Filters**: Pending, Approved, Rejected, Completed

### Advanced Search & Filtering

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

#### Cross-Warehouse Transfer Not Appearing

**Problem**: New cross-warehouse request not visible in receiving warehouse

**Solution**:

- Check if request was properly submitted
- Verify receiving warehouse selection
- Refresh the requests page
- Contact system administrator if issue persists

#### Cannot Accept Request

**Problem**: Accept button disabled or permission denied

**Solution**:

- Verify you have manager permissions for the receiving warehouse
- Check if you're accessing the correct warehouse dashboard
- Ensure request status is still "Pending"

#### Reserve Store Not Available

**Problem**: Cannot allocate products to Reserve Store during approval

**Solution**:

- Verify Reserve Store exists in the receiving warehouse
- Check store configuration and permissions
- Contact administrator to create/configure Reserve Store

#### Serial Number Conflicts

**Problem**: Serial numbers already exist in receiving warehouse

**Solution**:

- Review serial number details in the request
- Coordinate with sending warehouse to resolve conflicts
- Reject request with explanation if duplicates cannot be resolved

#### Store Allocation Required

**Problem**: Cannot accept request without selecting allocation stores

**Solution**:

- Ensure all products have store selections in receiver view
- Check that selected stores exist and are accessible
- Verify you have permissions to allocate to selected stores
- Contact administrator if store access issues persist

#### Bill Date Issues

**Problem**: Unable to set or modify bill dates for approved requests

**Solution**:

- Bill date picker only available for pending requests
- Once approved, bill dates cannot be modified
- Set correct date before approving the request
- Contact administrator for date corrections on approved requests

### Request Status Issues

#### Stuck in Pending Status

**Problem**: Request remains pending longer than expected

**Solution**:

- Check approval workflow for the request type
- Verify appropriate managers are notified
- Contact relevant personnel to review the request

#### Incorrect Request Type

**Problem**: Request created with wrong type (internal vs cross-warehouse)

**Solution**:

- Cannot change request type after creation
- Cancel incorrect request and create new one
- Use correct warehouse/store selection during creation

## üí° **Best Practices**
