# Requests & Approvals

Manage inventory requests, approval workflows, and transaction tracking across your warehouses. Learn how to handle pending requests, approve cross-warehouse transfers, and maintain proper inventory control through structured request management.

## üìã **What are Requests & Approvals?**

The Requests & Approvals system in Busiman provides structured control over inventory movements, ensuring that all stock transfers require proper authorization and tracking. This system prevents unauthorized inventory changes and maintains audit trails for all transactions.

    B --> C[üè™ Internal Transfer]
    B --> D[üè≠ Cross-Warehouse]
    B --> E[üì§ Check-Out]

    C --> F[Auto Approved]
    D --> G[Pending Approval]
    E --> H[Manager Approval]

    G --> I[‚úÖ Accept]
    G --> J[‚ùå Reject]

    I --> K[Stock Moved]
    J --> L[Request Cancelled]
```

## üìã **Cross-Warehouse Requests**

The Requests & Approvals system primarily handles **cross-warehouse transfers** - the only transfer type that requires approval before stock movement occurs. As shown in the diagram above, internal store transfers and check-out requests are processed immediately without creating approval requests.

### **Cross-Warehouse Transfer Process**

**Approval Required**: When products need to move between different warehouses, the receiving warehouse must approve the transfer before stock is actually moved.

- **Sending Warehouse**: Initiates the transfer request
- **Receiving Warehouse**: Reviews and approves/rejects the request
- **Approval Workflow**: Manager-level review required before stock movement
- **Reserve Store**: Approved products are automatically allocated to Reserve Store
- **Rejection**: If rejected, stock remains in the sending warehouse

## üìä **Managing Requests**

### Viewing Requests

Access request management through your warehouse dashboard:

1. **Navigate**: Dashboard ‚Üí Inventory ‚Üí Warehouse ‚Üí Requests
2. **Filter Options**:
   - **By Request**: View requests grouped by request ID
   - **By Product**: View individual products across requests
3. **Status Filters**: Pending, Approved, Rejected, Completed

### Request Details

Each cross-warehouse request displays comprehensive information:

- **Request ID**: Unique identifier for tracking
- **Date Created**: When the request was submitted
- **Status**: Current approval status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
- **Products**: Detailed list with quantities and serial numbers
- **Requester**: User who created the request
- **Warehouses**: Sending and receiving warehouse information

## ‚úÖ **Accepting Requests**

### Cross-Warehouse Transfer Approval

When a cross-warehouse request is received:

1. **Review Request**: Check product details, quantities, and serial numbers
2. **Verify Availability**: Ensure receiving warehouse can accommodate the transfer
3. **Accept Request**: Approve to move stock to Reserve Store
4. **Automatic Allocation**: Products are automatically added to Reserve Store

```

### Check-Out Request Approval

For customer sales and external issuances:

1. **Verify Customer**: Confirm customer details and requirements
2. **Check Stock**: Ensure sufficient inventory for the sale
3. **Review Documentation**: Verify bill/challan information
4. **Approve**: Process the check-out transaction

## ‚ùå **Rejecting Requests**

### Rejection Process

Requests can be rejected for various reasons:

- **Insufficient Stock**: Not enough inventory available
- **Invalid Request**: Incorrect product or quantity information
- **Policy Violation**: Request doesn't meet company policies
- **Warehouse Constraints**: Receiving warehouse cannot accommodate

### Warehouse-Specific Access

- **Warehouse Managers**: Can approve requests for their warehouse
- **Cross-Warehouse**: Only receiving warehouse can approve transfers
- **Check-Out**: Requires manager-level approval for external sales

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

#### Cross-Warehouse Transfer Not Appearing

**Problem**: New cross-warehouse request not visible in receiving warehouse

**Solution**:

- Check if request was properly submitted
- Verify receiving warehouse selection
- Refresh the requests page
- Contact system administrator if issue persists

#### Cannot Accept Request

**Problem**: Accept button disabled or permission denied

**Solution**:

- Verify you have manager permissions for the receiving warehouse
- Check if you're accessing the correct warehouse dashboard
- Ensure request status is still "Pending"

#### Reserve Store Not Available

**Problem**: Cannot allocate products to Reserve Store during approval

**Solution**:

- Verify Reserve Store exists in the receiving warehouse
- Check store configuration and permissions
- Contact administrator to create/configure Reserve Store

#### Serial Number Conflicts

**Problem**: Serial numbers already exist in receiving warehouse

**Solution**:

- Review serial number details in the request
- Coordinate with sending warehouse to resolve conflicts
- Reject request with explanation if duplicates cannot be resolved

### Request Status Issues

#### Stuck in Pending Status

**Problem**: Request remains pending longer than expected

**Solution**:

- Check approval workflow for the request type
- Verify appropriate managers are notified
- Contact relevant personnel to review the request

#### Incorrect Request Type

**Problem**: Request created with wrong type (internal vs cross-warehouse)

**Solution**:

- Cannot change request type after creation
- Cancel incorrect request and create new one
- Use correct warehouse/store selection during creation

## üí° **Best Practices**

### Request Management

- **Review Daily**: Check pending requests at the start of each day
- **Prompt Decisions**: Approve or reject requests within 24 hours
- **Clear Communication**: Provide reasons when rejecting requests
- **Documentation**: Maintain proper bill/challan records for check-outs

### Approval Workflow

- **Verify Details**: Always check product quantities and serial numbers
- **Stock Availability**: Confirm sufficient space in receiving locations
- **Policy Compliance**: Ensure requests meet company inventory policies
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain complete records for compliance

### Cross-Warehouse Coordination

- **Communication**: Coordinate with sending warehouse for large transfers
- **Planning**: Schedule transfers during appropriate business hours
- **Documentation**: Keep records of all cross-warehouse movements
- **Reserve Store**: Use Reserve Store for temporary holding of approved transfers
