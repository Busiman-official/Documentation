# Internal Transfers

Process internal transfers to move stock between stores within the same warehouse. Internal transfers support serial number tracking, immediate processing, and comprehensive validation for store-to-store movements.

## üéØ **What are Internal Transfers?**

Internal transfers move inventory between different stores within the same warehouse. This includes reorganizing stock, moving items between storage areas, or reallocating inventory for operational needs.

## üîÑ **When to Use Internal Transfers**

- **Store Reorganization**: Moving stock between storage locations
- **Inventory Rebalancing**: Redistributing stock across stores
- **Operational Needs**: Moving items for picking, packing, or processing
- **Space Optimization**: Clearing space in one store by moving to another
- **Quality Control**: Moving items to quarantine or inspection areas

:::info Alternative Methods
**Store transfers can also be performed through:**

- **Check-In Page**: Select "Store" as supplier type to receive from another store
- **Check-Out Page**: Select "Store" as recipient type to issue to another store

The Internal Transfer page is the dedicated interface for store-to-store movements within the same warehouse, offering streamlined validation and immediate processing.

- **Immediate Processing**: Process transfers as soon as items are physically moved

### Organization

- **Store Naming**: Use clear, descriptive store names for easy identification
- **Regular Audits**: Review transfer history to identify patterns
- **Space Planning**: Use transfers to optimize warehouse space utilization

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

#### Same Source and Destination

- Ensure source and destination stores are different
- Check store selection dropdown for correct options

#### Insufficient Stock

- Verify available quantity in source store
- Check for concurrent transfers affecting stock levels
- Refresh product list to get latest inventory data

#### Serial Number Issues

- For standard serializable: ensure exact serial count matches quantity
- For define serial later: check that non-serialized quantity doesn't exceed available stock
- Verify serials exist in source store and aren't already transferred

#### Product Not Available

- Check product exists in selected source store
- Verify user permissions for accessing the store
- Refresh product list if inventory was recently updated

#### Processing Failures

- Check validation errors and correct data
- Verify store selections are valid
- Contact support for persistent processing issues
