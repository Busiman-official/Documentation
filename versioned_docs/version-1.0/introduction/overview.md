# Busiman Overview

## 🎯 **What is Busiman?**

Busiman is a **free, complete business management system** designed for Indian businesses. Manage your inventory, branches, teams, and operations - all in one place.

## 🏢 **How Your Business Works in Busiman**

Busiman organizes your business like a real company structure. Your main company can have multiple branches (like Delhi, Agra, Mumbai), and each branch can have different departments (Sales, Inventory, Production, etc.). Within each department, you have team members with different roles.

**Example Structure:**

- **Company Level**: Overall business settings and executive decisions
- **Branch Level**: Location-specific operations and management
- **Department Level**: Specialized functions like sales, inventory, or production
- **Team Level**: Individual employees with specific roles and permissions

This flexible structure lets you mirror your real business exactly, whether you have 1 branch or 100 branches. Each branch can have different departments and team members based on their specific needs.
