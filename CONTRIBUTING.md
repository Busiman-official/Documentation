How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your change:
   - git checkout -b feat/your-feature
2. Make small, focused commits with clear messages.
3. Run the docs build locally to verify no broken links or errors:
   - npm install
   - npm run build
   - npm run serve
4. Open a pull request against `main`. Link any related issue and describe your changes.

Guidelines

- Documentation first: prefer adding/updating docs, examples, and screenshots where helpful.
- Style: use Markdown with clear headings, code fences, and frontmatter if adding new docs pages.
- Localization: keep content simple and avoid idiomatic phrasing to ease translation.
